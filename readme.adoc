== Introduction to JSA_IP_PREF

A hostname can be either a domain name (www.example.com) or an IP address.  When
use an IPv4 address as hostname, you can just specify a part of full IPv4
address after set the environment variable `JSA_IP_PREF` properly.

For example:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Input | JSA_IP_PREF | Result IPv4

| 7
| 192.168.0
| 192.168.0.7

| 7.7 
| 192.168.0
| 192.168.7.7

| 7.7.7.7
| 192.168.0
| 7.7.7.7

| 7.7
| 192
| (Invalid)
|===

The input can be 1~4 segments.
